        <h1>Blog Post 1</h1>
        <p>
            After working on this for around five hours and through two vertigo episodes, I finally
            got my website to appear under the correct domain name.  I also am finally able to ssh
            from both PuTTy and Visual Studio Code.  What a headache.
        </p>
        <h2>What I've Learned</h2>
        <p>
            I can start out by telling you that I definitely have not learned how to place a max
            width on this page yet.  Its going to look like a bunch of long lines across your screen
            until then.  I will probably keep track of changes to previous blog posts in some clever
            way.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have learned how to make
            <ul>
                <li>nested lists</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>like this</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>annoying thing.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            It says to attach source code but I don't know how to do that without html spitting it 
            out as a garbled mess.  I will update this when I figure it out.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have learned how to link to different files in my html, and how to set up these 
            lovely domains and subdomains (sort of, I'm going to need some review on the how to 
            create subdomains topic).
        </p>
        <h2>What I Hope To Learn</h2>
        <p>
            Some CSS... please.  This website looks awful.  I will probably do some reading on 
            Wednesday if nobody comes in for tutoring.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also how to move my subdomain handling over to Digital Ocean.  It would be very 
            convenient to have all of my managing in one location, and they said something about
            moving nameservices over from Namecheap...  I don't really know what that is about.
        </p>
        <h2>Things I am Confused About</h2>
        <p>
            Are we never supposed to work on our remote server, and only supposed to pull from the 
            git repository, as I have been writing this on it and it is nice.  The workflow is very
            simple and goes something like:
            <ol>
                <li>Write html code.</li>
                <li>Alt+tab.</li>
                <li>Refresh browser</li>
                <li>Do you like it? If so, commit the change, otherwise, repeat.</li>
            </ol>
            Of course I can understand that for larger changes it would definitely be preferrable 
            to just work on your local repository and then commit-and-login-and-pull.  However, 
            I am comfortable with this workflow for now.
        </p>
        <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            I'm taking CS 374 Database Systems along with this course, and I was hoping to link up 
            the database to this website in some way.  We'll see.
