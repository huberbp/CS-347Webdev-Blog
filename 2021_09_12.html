            <h1>Blog Post 2</h1>
            <p>
                For the last blog post I had fallen a bit behind the classes' pace with all of the 
                wild circumstances going on in my life, but today I rejoice as I have caught up. I
                have learned a couple things pertaining to web developement this week and can put 
                those up here along with the sources I got them from.

                <h2>What I've Learned</h2>
                <p>
                    For starters, I've learned quite a bit about CSS this week.  For instance, I've
                    learned how to make this page quite a deal more appealing to the eye, and appear 
                    relatively more consistant across browsers.  I've used an external CSS style sheet 
                    today, but you can use 2 other methods.  You can also use a <span class="code">style</span> section in your
                    header and a style attribute to what you're manipulating.  I've learned that the 
                    priority for what gets displayed when style sheets conflict is:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Inline style.</li>
                        <li>External and header style sections.</li>
                        <li>Your browser's default style sheet.</li>
                    </ol>
                    According to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp" target=_blank>w3schools css tutorial</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Speaking of CSS, its very time-consuming.  I've been sitting here making this 
                    external style sheet that barely looks presentable for around 30 minutes now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've also learned about <span class="code">&ltdiv&gt</span> and <span class="code">&ltspan&gt</span> elements
                    that can be used for more general purposes, enabling me to change the style of web-pages that may be less 
                    structurally independent from its surroundings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's also all sorts of things regarding block elements vs. inline elements that I have learned about, 
                    however I need more practice with them before I can list them off the top of my head.
